Nicholas Dove is a postdoctoral associate in the Biosciences division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory working primarily in the Plant-Microbe Interfaces SFA. Dr. Dove is interested in the mediators of microbial community assembly and how this influences plant and ecosystem health. Nicholas earned his Ph.D. at the University of California, Merced working under Stephen Hart. Additionally, he was awarded a graduate research fellowship at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. During his Ph.D., Nicholas used a combination of next-generation sequencing technologies and biogeochemical assays to determine the impact of global change stressors on microbial communities and their function. In his current position, Nicholas studies the temporal dynamics of plant microbiome community assembly. Nicholas hopes that his fundamental research on microbial ecology can someday be used towards applications that enhance agricultural productivity and ecosystem sustainability.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, skiing, traveling, and playing my guitar (poorly).
