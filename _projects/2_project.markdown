While soils store ~1500 Pg of carbon (C), it is currently unclear how climate change will affect this large C pool. The effect of temperature on enzyme kinetics predicts that as temperatures warm, microbial activity and cellular respiration will increase, releasing C from soils into the atmosphere. However, the long-term effect of warming on soil likely impacts a myriad of factors affecting the persistence of soil C. Recent evidence from a 20-y warming experiment suggests that soil respiration responds non-monotonically to warming over time; although, the mechanistic factors for this have yet to be elucidated. 

We used a 4.5 y whole-profile soil warming experiment coupled with laboratory incubations amended with different resources to show that soil microbial communities in warmed soils have altered nutrient demands, which profoundly impacts their community composition and metabolism. These differences could account for previously unexplained patterns, and these insights could help constrain predictions for soil C persistence in a warmed world.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

<div class="col three caption">
    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
</div>
