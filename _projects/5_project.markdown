Most soil microbial ecology is studied in the upper 20 cm; yet, important microbes and processes occur below this depth. At the <a href="https://criticalzone.org/sierra/">Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory</a> and <a href="https://www.wmrc.edu/">White Mountians Research Center</a>, we have dug a series of soil pits to the weathered bedrock. I use these pits to study the microbial communities and their activity. With <a href="https://criticalzone.org/sierra/people/person/moreland-kimber/">Kimber Moreland</a> and <a href="http://criticalzone.org/sierra/people/person/barnes-morgan/">Morgan Barnes</a> studying soil carbon and phosphorus, respectively, I hope to link microbial communities with soil biogeochemical characteristics along the soil profile and across different environments.
